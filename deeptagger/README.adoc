deeptagger
==========

This is an automatic image tagger/classifier written in C++,
without using any Python, and primarily targets various anime models.

Unfortunately, you will still need Python and some luck to prepare the models,
achieved by running download.sh.  You will need about 20 gigabytes of space.

Very little effort is made to make this work on non-Unix systems.

Getting this to work
--------------------
To build the evaluator, install a C++ compiler, CMake, and development packages
of GraphicsMagick and ONNX Runtime.

Prebuilt ONNX Runtime can be most conveniently downloaded from
https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases[GitHub releases].
Remember to install CUDA packages, such as _nvidia-cudnn_ on Debian,
if you plan on using the GPU-enabled options.

 $ cmake -DONNXRuntime_ROOT=/path/to/onnxruntime -B build
 $ cmake --build build
 $ ./download.sh
 $ build/deeptagger models/deepdanbooru-v3-20211112-sgd-e28.model image.jpg
