gallery
=======

This is gallery software designed to maintain a shadow structure
of your filesystem, in which you can attach metadata to your media,
and query your collections in various ways.

All media is content-addressed by its SHA-1 hash value, and at your option
also perceptually hashed.  Duplicate search is an essential feature.

Prerequisites: Go, ImageMagick, xdg-utils

ImageMagick v7 is preferred, it doesn't shoot out of memory as often.

The gallery is designed for simplicity, and easy interoperability.
sqlite3, curl, jq, and the filesystem will take you a long way.

The intended mode of use is running daily automated sync/thumbnail/dhash/tag
batches in a cron job, or from a system timer.  See _test.sh_ for usage hints.
